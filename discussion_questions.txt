Runtime
1. The number of crackers in the box.
2.
O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n^2)
O(2^n)

Stacks and Queues
1.1. Stack
1.2. Queue
1.3 Neither. As the expression is written in the example, either a stack or queue would return the wrong answer as it would not account for mathematical rules like multiplication coming before addition or functions within parenthesis being handled first. I feel like a tree would be a better structure or a stack with post fix notation.

Linked Lists
1. The objects containing Apple, Berry, and Cherry are the nodes. The data for each is word Apple, Berry, and Cherry respectively. The head is the node containing Apple. The tail is the node containing Cherry.
2. Singly-linked lists only have a next. Doubly-linked lists have a next and a previous.
3. If we do not keep track of the tail, we would have to iterate through the whole list until we found the node with none as next before appending.

Trees
1. Food, Italian, Indian, Mexican, lasagna, pizza, tikka masala, saag, burritos
2. Food, Italian, lasagna, pizza, thin-crust, Chicago-style
3. A binary search tree has a left child and a right child and a rule for arrangement.
